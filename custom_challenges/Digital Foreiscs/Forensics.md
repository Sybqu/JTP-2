# 1. Hide and Seek

---

##  Challenge Description

description.txt
Description:

Sakamoto’s at it again with a game of hide and seek, but this time, it’s not with Shin or his daughter.
An old friend hid some secret data in this image. Can you find it before the others do?

Hint:
Even in retirement, Sakamoto never loses at hide and seek. Maybe stegseek can help you keep up
