# Description

After last year's automation and tech modernisation, Santa's workshop got a new makeover.
McSkidy has a secure message portal where you can contact her directly with any questions or concerns.
However, lately, the logs have been lighting up with unusual activity, ranging from odd messages to suspicious search terms. 
Even Santa's letters appear to be scripts or random code. Your mission, should you choose to accept it: 
dig through the logs, uncover the mischief, and figure out who's trying to mess with McSkidy.
