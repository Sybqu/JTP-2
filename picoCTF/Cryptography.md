# 1. RSA ORACLE

> Can you abuse the oracle?
An attacker was able to intercept communications between a bank and a fintech company. They managed to get the message (ciphertext) and the password that was used to encrypt the message.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution:

- RSA encryption knowledge required
- Finding the public key
- A Bit of mathematics
 - c = m^e mod n
  m^e - c is divisble by n
   Also the corollary of the RSA algorithm GCD of e and m^e - c needs to be n

- We run plain text attack to get values of e and n (the code for which i did not write again..because i suck at ts...even having trouble understanding but we hard)

```python

    """Send message to oracle and get ciphertext"""

    # Receive initial menu
    response = s.recv(4096).decode()
    
    # Send 'E' for encrypt
    s.send(b'E\n')
    time.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Receive prompt for text
    response = s.recv(4096).decode()
    
    # Send our message
    s.send(message.encode() + b'\n')
    
    # Get response with ciphertext

- Mathematical exploit using property of RSA (multiplying cipher texts is same as multiplying their plaintexts and the e^mod n)
- So we use a random multipler from our side lets say 2 i used because most basic . So we decrypt this new ciphertext and get our password
- But decrypted output : 2* password
- Dividing by our multipler (2 in this case) gave us our pass 
- Decrypting secret.enc using openssl <given in picoCTF hints>
## Flag:

```
picoCTF{su((3ss_(r@ck1ng_r3@_24bcbc66}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- RSA algorithm full working
 - Plain text attack , Properties of RSA
- CPA , CCA vulnerability exploitation
## Notes:

- I tried to look for other methods<manual> to find e and n but since they were so big a script was the perfect way
- Had problem at the "multiplier" part. Understood the logic till finding e and n

# 2. Custom Encryption

> Can you get sense of this code file and write the function that will decode the given encrypted file content.
Find the encrypted file here flag_info and code file might be good to analyze and get the flag.
## Solution:

- Checking the source code
- 2 main types of encryption
 - "encrypt" and dynamic_XOR

- Decryption method
 1. undo "encrypt"
 2. undo "dynamic_XOR"
 3. Reverse the plaintext

- We have to 2 type of keys : "shared_key" and XOR key "trudeau"
- We need to calculate the value of shared key using given data
- Calculation of Shared key
 - We calculate individual keys first
 ```
 Calculate v and u as per the given info in the code
 pow(v, a, p) and pow(u, b, p) respectively using given data.
 
 ```
- We get shared_key=6 as both keys=6
- In "encrypt"
 : (ord(char) * key * 311)
 To decrypt we divide the elements of "cipher" by key*311 
- End up with a semi cypher
- Now applying XOR with key repeating
- Revering the plaintext and getting the key

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{custom_d2cr0pt6d_49fbee5b}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Understanding Diffie-hellman system
- Understand "keys" in the diffie hellman system and the secret values a and b
- XOR encryption and reversing text
## Notes:

- initially calculated the key wrong and cried quite a bit.<didnt , sike!>
- Dcode gave me some trouble <they want me to unblock trackers and ads . Dawg i use GX >
